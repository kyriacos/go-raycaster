# go-raycaster
Simple raycaster in Go using SDL.

There's plenty of comments in the code. Check it out if you are interested and just email me if you have any questions.

*The textures in the images directory are from Wolfenstein 3D and are copyrights belong to ID Software.*

##TODO:
- Add more details
- Clean up code
- Add textures for floor and ceiling
- Optimize the code. Figure out a way to make it run faster. It's very slow...
